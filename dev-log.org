  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  emrun is a command line tool that can run generated HTML pages via a
  locally launched web server. This is helpful when using web browsers
  that cannot run a generated .html file via a file:// URL (e.g. by
  double-clicking the file) because of the default browser CORS rules.

  Files that you want to access should be preloaded or embedded into
  the virtual file system. Preloading (or embedding) generates a
  virtual file system that corresponds to the file system structure at
  compile time, relative to the current directory.
